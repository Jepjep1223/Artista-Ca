He is a Filipino visual artist raised\n                in the Town of Sto Tomas Batangas and current living in Calamba\n                since 1996. He was an undergraduate under Architectural &amp;\n                Design Drafting course at Malvar Polytechnic College (BSU) with\n                strong ambitions and recognized for his versatility across\n                various styles and mediums. Growing up in the Philippines, his\n                passion for art ignited a journey of self-expression and\n                exploration. His talent and skills made this his source of\n                income since a young age and a stepping stone for him to accept\n                offers to go to other countries to pursue working with his\n                knowledge of arts for such a long time in Art &amp; Design\n                Advertising Company and Interior Art Decorations.

His artistic journey\n                began in high school, where he discovered a passion for creating\n                art. In 2008, Ram found a unique way to blend his love for\n                painting and entrepreneurship by offering freehand-painted\n                t-shirts to customers, a skill he attributes to his father’s\n                love for creative projects.\n              </span>\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              <span>\n                Ram&apos;s journey in the art world took a significant turn when\n                he joined the Artists Association of Calamba (AAC),\n                participating in group exhibits at the Calamba City Hall and the\n                historic Jose Rizal Shrine.\n              </span>\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              <span>\n                For Ram, art is more than just a visual experience.

He\n                believes that art is a unique form of self-expression, allowing\n                individuals to explore extraordinary ideas beyond the grasp of\n                ordinary perception.\n              </span>\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              <span>\n                Ram&apos;s motto, &quot;Enjoy life, without worries,&quot;\n                reflects his approach to both life and art.
